# PHYS580-Project
Code from my final project. The code was written to accompany the paper
I would recommend running each simulation separately (they each have a number at the end of the name indicating the order in which they were intended to be run).
If you prefer to view the code altogether, the files titled "PHYS580_Project.py" is the one for you

Feel free to vary some of the initial values for dim, i, and r. Be careful, as some values won't work if they
are out of range.
